**Powering the Future: Considerations of Grid Expansion and Decentralized Solutions**

**Abstract**


Electric power systems worldwide face critical choices between expanding centralized grids and deploying decentralized microgrids with battery storage. This study examines the economic and social trade-offs of these alternatives, focusing on net present value (NPV), system-wide welfare impacts, and adoption dynamics. We employ a three-pronged methodology: (1) a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to compare lifecycle costs, reliability benefits, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for grid extension versus microgrids in a representative rural community; (2) a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated with U.S. regional data to simulate macroeconomic effects in urban and rural contexts; and (3) an Agent-Based Model (ABM) capturing household adoption thresholds, peer effects, and the impact of a 30% upfront subsidy over a 10-year horizon.

The CBA reveals that grid extension—incurring capital costs of \$2.55 million and an LCOE of \~\$2.60/kWh—yields a strongly negative NPV, whereas a well-sized microgrid (total investment \$0.78 million, LCOE \~\$0.89/kWh) produces a positive NPV, with a breakeven distance of approximately 27 km from existing infrastructure. CGE results show microgrid deployment in rural areas raises real household utility by \~6.8% and boosts local GDP by \~2.6%, compared to 4.5% and 2.1% gains under centralized expansion in urban settings. The ABM illustrates a classic S-curve of adoption, reaching 68% uptake by year 10 under baseline conditions and over 90% with targeted subsidies.

Our findings underscore the importance of geographically differentiated policies: decentralized microgrids are economically and socially optimal in remote, underserved regions, while centralized grids remain efficient in densely populated areas. We recommend targeted financial incentives, streamlined regulations, and pilot programs to accelerate microgrid adoption. Future work should refine behavioral assumptions, incorporate market frictions, and validate outcomes against real-world deployments.
